  "Parisa Mahjoor": "Professor Mahjoor in the Chemistry department receives generally low ratings, particularly concerning student difficulties and clarity of material. Students describe her courses as relatively easy, especially CHEM 110. Weekly quizzes with dropped low scores, a comprehensive final study guide, and a lack of homework seem to be common characteristics of her classes. While perceived as intimidating initially, she warms up throughout the quarter and can be helpful. Be prepared for potentially dry lectures and some challenges understanding due to accent. https://polyratings.dev/professor/0038ea39-3910-4f80-9353-41dce33c754d",

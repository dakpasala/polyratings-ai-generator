Students can expect to be responsible for learning most of the material on their own, with minimal guidance from the professor. The professor's teaching style is often described as unhelpful, with a tendency to yell and get upset when students ask questions. This can be overwhelming for many students, especially those who are not familiar with the subject matter. Unfortunately, it appears that students who do not supplement their learning with external resources such as YouTube videos and Google may struggle to succeed in the class.\n\nFrom the available data, it seems that students in CHEM 312, CHEM 127, and CHEM 124 are struggling in this class. It's difficult to pinpoint a specific year when students succeed or don't succeed, but based on the overall rating of 0.5/4.0, it's clear that many students are having a negative experience with this professor.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about Professor Elangovan's teaching style and see how other students have rated him, I recommend checking out his PolyRatings page:\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/2f08a398-4ed3-4eb1-862b-b93a246fd003",

Specific concerns include a high homework load, difficult grading (especially considering the course's perceived ease), and the inclusion of a midterm, which is unusual for ME 234. Students suggest Professor Emberley's approach to ME 234, particularly its focus on project management and perceived arbitrary grading, leads to a disproportionate amount of work.\n\nHere are 5 descriptive sentences about Professor Emberley:\n\n1.  Professor Emberley's overall rating suggests that most students find her to be below average compared to other professors.\n2.

  "Sarah Stewart": "Okay, here's a summary based on the provided data and student comments for Professor Sarah Stewart:\n\nProfessor Stewart is generally well-regarded, achieving an overall rating of 3.66/4.0 based on 9 evaluations. She's known for her strong grasp of the subject matter, especially when it comes to horses, and is considered approachable and easy to talk to. Students generally find her teaching of material clear, with a 3.79/4.0 rating. However, students may find the workload and depth of knowledge required in her courses, particularly ASCI 112, overwhelming if they lack prior experience in animal science. Labs might be perceived as long and the exam wording tricky. While she doesn't post her slides, she offers information that isn't on the slides so students need to listen in class to succeed.\n\nGiven the student feedback suggesting a high level of information and demanding labs, it's likely that **upper-level students** or those already familiar with animal science concepts will succeed more readily in her courses. **Freshmen or students with limited prior exposure** to the field might find the initial learning curve steeper, particularly in ASCI 112.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/3100296b-aa65-41e7-b10f-453a03a3b64a",

  "Robert Cichowski": "Based on the provided data, here's a summary of Professor Robert Cichowski:\n\nProfessor Robert Cichowski is a CHEM department professor known for his engaging personality, but his teaching skills are a different story. Students can expect to learn from a lecture style that focuses more on memorization and less on in-depth understanding, often relying on textbooks as the primary source of learning. His lectures may be time-wasting and unengaging, but students can still succeed by teaching themselves from the book and putting in extra effort. Unfortunately, this approach may not be ideal for students who require a stronger instructor-led learning environment. On average, students who succeed in his classes tend to be those who are self-motivated and able to learn independently, particularly in the CHEM 124 course.\n\nIt appears that students who tend to succeed in Professor Cichowski's classes are likely those who are more self-directed and can effectively learn from textbooks, while students who struggle may be those who require a more engaging and interactive teaching style. However, more data would be necessary to confirm this trend.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/53445c32-0779-4179-84b0-e301b22fd05b",

  "John Astaire": "Professor John Astaire from the Music Department (MU) at Cal Poly is known for being a demanding yet supportive instructor who assigns regular homework assignments, concert reviews, and exams that test students' understanding of music concepts. Students can expect to spend time understanding the underlying concepts in the homework assignments, which are relatively easy once grasped, and to be graded on their ability to apply those concepts to real-world music scenarios. Astaire's grading is strict, but he offers flexibility with deadlines and allows resubmissions if students struggle with assignments. Students who succeed in his classes tend to have prior music experience or have a strong musical background, but Astaire's teaching style and support make it accessible to students learning music for the first time. Overall, students who are willing to put in the effort to understand the material and meet deadlines tend to perform well in Astaire's classes.\n\nAs for which years succeed and don't succeed, based on the limited data, it seems that students who have prior music experience or technical music skills tend to perform better in Astaire's classes. In contrast, students who are new to music or struggle with music theory may find the coursework challenging, as reflected in a 4/4.0 rating for \"Student Difficulties\".

She tends to read directly from her PowerPoint slides during lectures, often spending less than 2 minutes on each slide, which can make it difficult for students to take notes. Students who are self-learners and prefer to read the textbook on their own may find her lectures unnecessary, but those who need guidance and clarification may struggle. The professor's midterms are reportedly easy, but mastering the material requires individual effort. Overall, students who are proactive and can teach themselves may succeed in her class, but those who require more guidance may find it difficult.\n\nAs for which years succeed and don't succeed, it seems that students who are in their junior and senior years, and are already familiar with the subject matter, tend to do well in her classes.

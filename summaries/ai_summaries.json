  "Parisa Mahjoor": "Professor Mahjoor is known for offering relatively easy chemistry courses, particularly CHEM 110, with a focus on weekly quizzes and a comprehensive study guide for the final. Students can expect a structured class with clear expectations, but may find lectures dry and the instructor hard to understand at times.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/0038ea39-3910-4f80-9353-41dce33c754d",
  "Chris Clark": "Professor Chris Clark of the CRP department receives high ratings, with students noting clear materials and approaches to student difficulties.

  "Tiev LaGuire": "Professor LaGuire of the FSN department has an overall rating of 2.57/4.0 based on 13 evaluations. Students find the clarity of the material and addressing student difficulties to be around average. Reviews of online courses, specifically FSN 210, are particularly negative. Students cite poorly edited pre-recorded lectures, strict grading, and a lack of instructor support as major issues. Exams are perceived as difficult and heavily reliant on textbook memorization without adequate guidance. Students who struggle with learning solely from textbooks may find her courses challenging. https://polyratings.dev/professor/00933936-63a6-4486-8bfa-ac53f1794a72",
  "Danielle Steussy": "Professor Steussy is a relatively new GRC professor and a Cal Poly alumna. While considered a supportive and approachable instructor (\"a saint\" compared to another professor), her lack of experience and current GrC knowledge can lead to confusion and frustration in the classroom. Students may encounter troubleshooting issues she can't immediately resolve. On the positive side, she's highly responsive to emails and offers flexibility with assignment deadlines. Her strengths lie in her accessibility and willingness to help students. https://polyratings.dev/professor/0099c43a-2262-4788-a0a9-dc920cce01b9",
  "Amanda Lathrop": "Here's a summary of Professor Lathrop's performance based on the provided data:\n\nProfessor Amanda Lathrop in the FSN department receives mixed reviews, with an overall rating of 2.22/4.0. Students find the course material somewhat clear (2.67/4.0), but struggle significantly with the difficulty (1.89/4.0). She is often perceived as a tough grader, and students find her expectations to be very high. A common complaint is the overwhelming amount of information presented in lectures, often read directly from powerpoints, making test preparation challenging and leading to frustration. While students may find her knowledgeable and like her as a person, the demanding nature of her courses can lead to burnout, and a need for a break from her teaching style. Based on the courses she teaches (FSN 125 and FSN 275), it is likely that Freshman and Sophomores struggle most with her rigor, whereas Juniors and Seniors are more accustomed to these challenges.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/00f2faeb-fd74-42d0-a3dc-80399f998432",
  "Nancy Rucci": "Okay, based on the provided data, here's a summary of Professor Rucci:\n\nProfessor Rucci receives mixed reviews, averaging a 2.5/4.0 overall rating. Students generally acknowledge her positive and understanding attitude. Some find her teaching style unstructured and feel she doesn't adequately explain concepts, especially in introductory courses. Others appreciate her interactive classes, willingness to answer questions clearly, and incorporation of cultural elements. The comments suggest that homework and tests are relatively easy, providing an opportunity to achieve a good grade with consistent attendance. Students taking lower level spanish courses may find it harder to understand due to a glossing over of some concepts. Students taking higher level courses tend to enjoy her teaching style.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/014d53f2-90d0-46ad-a3fc-0877e2238b08",
  "Cheryl-lyn Ngoh": "Based on the limited data, here's a summary of Professor Cheryl-lyn Ngoh's BUS 418 course:\n\nProfessor Ngoh's overall rating is relatively low (2.4/4.0) based on a small sample size. Her strengths appear to be in material clarity (3.4/4.0) and understanding student difficulties (3/4.0), however, student comments show a disconnect. Students can expect a course with lengthy lectures, activities that may feel pointless, and a significant portion of the grade tied to end-of-quarter group projects, papers, and a final exam. The professor is perceived as a harsh grader, providing little guidance on projects, and potentially avoiding direct answers to student questions. As of the date of writing, this appears to be the only professor who teaches this course, so all students from every year are expected to take this course with this professor. Students may face challenges in BUS 418 due to the lack of prior ratings and a potentially steep learning curve.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/0152ac87-4953-4fba-85b7-eeb0f6ac045f",
  "Jean Athey": "Here's a summary of Professor Athey based on the provided data:\n\nProfessor Athey, in the BUS department, teaches BUS 291 and BUS 391, but has a low overall rating of 2/4 based on a small sample of 5 evaluations. Student find the material moderately clear (2.44/4.0) and report the course presents some difficulties (2.11/4.0). Students should expect a course with computer projects, midterms, and a final exam, heavily reliant on readings and lecture notes. Memorization is key to success, so creating notecards is recommended. The professor is perceived by some as inflexible on certain issues, while others find her accommodating and willing to award points. The difficulty of the tests seems to be a recurring theme, with students finding them challenging due to obscure details from the readings. It is difficult to comment on the class that succeeds because we do not have the year or the subject of the class.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/015ecf8c-bbc3-4c19-bf85-65f9beded8a4"

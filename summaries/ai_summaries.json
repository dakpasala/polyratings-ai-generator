  "Danielle Steussy": "Professor Steussy is a relatively new GRC professor and a Cal Poly alumna. While considered a supportive and approachable instructor (\"a saint\" compared to another professor), her lack of experience and current GrC knowledge can lead to confusion and frustration in the classroom. Students may encounter troubleshooting issues she can't immediately resolve. On the positive side, she's highly responsive to emails and offers flexibility with assignment deadlines. Her strengths lie in her accessibility and willingness to help students. https://polyratings.dev/professor/0099c43a-2262-4788-a0a9-dc920cce01b9",
  "Amanda Lathrop": "Here's a summary of Professor Lathrop's performance based on the provided data:\n\nProfessor Amanda Lathrop in the FSN department receives mixed reviews, with an overall rating of 2.22/4.0. Students find the course material somewhat clear (2.67/4.0), but struggle significantly with the difficulty (1.89/4.0). She is often perceived as a tough grader, and students find her expectations to be very high. A common complaint is the overwhelming amount of information presented in lectures, often read directly from powerpoints, making test preparation challenging and leading to frustration. While students may find her knowledgeable and like her as a person, the demanding nature of her courses can lead to burnout, and a need for a break from her teaching style. Based on the courses she teaches (FSN 125 and FSN 275), it is likely that Freshman and Sophomores struggle most with her rigor, whereas Juniors and Seniors are more accustomed to these challenges.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/00f2faeb-fd74-42d0-a3dc-80399f998432",

Others appreciate her interactive classes, willingness to answer questions clearly, and incorporation of cultural elements. The comments suggest that homework and tests are relatively easy, providing an opportunity to achieve a good grade with consistent attendance. Students taking lower level spanish courses may find it harder to understand due to a glossing over of some concepts.

  "Cheryl-lyn Ngoh": "Based on the limited data, here's a summary of Professor Cheryl-lyn Ngoh's BUS 418 course:\n\nProfessor Ngoh's overall rating is relatively low (2.4/4.0) based on a small sample size. Her strengths appear to be in material clarity (3.4/4.0) and understanding student difficulties (3/4.0), however, student comments show a disconnect. Students can expect a course with lengthy lectures, activities that may feel pointless, and a significant portion of the grade tied to end-of-quarter group projects, papers, and a final exam. The professor is perceived as a harsh grader, providing little guidance on projects, and potentially avoiding direct answers to student questions. As of the date of writing, this appears to be the only professor who teaches this course, so all students from every year are expected to take this course with this professor. Students may face challenges in BUS 418 due to the lack of prior ratings and a potentially steep learning curve.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/0152ac87-4953-4fba-85b7-eeb0f6ac045f",

Memorization is key to success, so creating notecards is recommended. The professor is perceived by some as inflexible on certain issues, while others find her accommodating and willing to award points. The difficulty of the tests seems to be a recurring theme, with students finding them challenging due to obscure details from the readings. It is difficult to comment on the class that succeeds because we do not have the year or the subject of the class.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/015ecf8c-bbc3-4c19-bf85-65f9beded8a4",

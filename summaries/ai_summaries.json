His lectures are often dull and may not engage students, with some students even catching up on other work during class. However, he offers group homework assignments that are relatively easy and flexible, as well as a lenient final exam that allows students to choose a problem to skip. Despite the lack of a clear grade breakdown, his final exam and term paper appear to make up a significant portion of the final grade. Overall, students can expect a relatively easy class with minimal expectations, but may not learn much from the experience.\n\nAs for which years succeed and don't succeed, based on the single evaluation, it seems that the student who provided the evaluation had a mixed experience, enjoying the professor's humor and tangents but struggling with the disorganization and lack of engagement in the class.

  "Amanda Emberly": "Okay, here's a summary of Professor Amanda Emberley based on the data provided:\n\nProfessor Amanda Emberley in the Mechanical Engineering (ME) department has received an overall rating of 2.57/4.0 based on 7 evaluations. Students perceive her teaching style as lacking clarity, with a rating of 2.43/4.0 for material clarity. While she appears understanding of student difficulties (2.86/4.0), student comments indicate a disconnect between the expected workload and grading difficulty in her ME 234 course. Specific concerns include a high homework load, difficult grading (especially considering the course's perceived ease), and the inclusion of a midterm, which is unusual for ME 234. Students suggest Professor Emberley's approach to ME 234, particularly its focus on project management and perceived arbitrary grading, leads to a disproportionate amount of work.\n\nHere are 5 descriptive sentences about Professor Emberley:\n\n1.  Professor Emberley's overall rating suggests that most students find her to be below average compared to other professors.\n2.  She's characterized as assigning a heavy workload, especially in ME 234, which students find unexpected for a course traditionally seen as easier.\n3.  Clarity of course material seems to be a consistent concern, as reflected in the low rating in this category.\n4.  Students describe her grading of projects as \"aggressively harsh\" and \"arbitrary\".\n5.  Her deviation from the standard ME 234 curriculum, particularly her emphasis on project management, may contribute to student dissatisfaction.\n\nFrom this limited data, it appears that students taking ME 234 may struggle under Professor Emberley's approach, especially if they are expecting a lighter workload and more relaxed grading. Given the emphasis on ME 234 in the comments, students taking ME 211 might have a different experience, but the small sample size makes it difficult to generalize. Freshmen and sophomores who usually take the ME 234 course might have a difficult time adjusting to her.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/2ffcd9a9-9c66-470a-99cb-79678559847e",
  "Joe Whitt": "Okay, here's a summary of Professor Joe Whitt based on the provided data:\n\nProfessor Whitt is consistently rated highly by students, achieving a perfect 4.0/4.0 overall rating. Students find his course material clear and appreciate his understanding of student difficulties. His COMS 101 class is structured around practical application, primarily involving the preparation and delivery of different types of speeches (impromptu, invitational, and advocacy). Professor Whitt is perceived as a \"chill\" and approachable instructor who provides helpful feedback. Students emphasize that as long as you put in the work, passing the class with a good grade is highly achievable. The course structure, which seems to work well asynchronously, involves recording speeches, reflecting on them, and completing a final exam. Based on the class structure the most successful years would be students who are at least in their second year of college, or 2nd year college students because they are more likely to have experience with public speaking. On the other hand, Freshman students would not succeed as well because they have less experience with public speaking.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/301050f4-eea1-44cf-b7a2-b24626c91cad",
  "Colum Yip": "Here's a short summary of Professor Colum Yip based on the provided data:\n\nProfessor Yip of the ENGL department receives generally positive evaluations, with an overall rating of 3.5/4.0.

Students can expect a seminar-style class structure, which may start off somewhat boring but becomes more engaging in the latter half with group activities. The grading breakdown involves a mix of homework, a final paper, presentations, participation, and reading quizzes. Professor Yip is known for being an easy grader, providing detailed feedback on assignments, and creating a chill class environment, especially for students interested in linguistics. Based on the courses taught (ENGL 391, 395, 492, 495, 497), junior, senior, and graduate-level students are most likely to take his courses; there is no current evidence that any particular year has difficulty in this course.\nProfessor Yip is known for the following:\n\n*   Being an easy grader, which he openly admits.\n*   Providing detailed and helpful feedback on student work.\n*   Creating a relatively relaxed and \"chill\" classroom environment.\n*   Structuring his classes with a variety of assignments, including homework, a final paper, presentations, quizzes, and participation.\n*   Having classes that become more engaging as the quarter progresses, incorporating group activities after a lecture-heavy start.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/301ef50a-d3ae-495d-90e4-8990ab1461c6",

Some students report positive experiences, while others express concern about perceived grade discrepancies and unprofessional communication. Based on a negative comment it seems the biggest issue is upper class men don't do so well in this course, it seems as though freshmen and sophomores tend to do well in her courses due to her teaching style. Students should be aware that experiences may vary, and it's advisable to seek additional perspectives to form a well-rounded understanding of the professor's teaching style.\n\nHere are 5 descriptive sentences about Professor Forte based on this data:\n\n1.

However, some students express concern about preparedness for common final exams despite doing well on his practice tests, suggesting a potential disconnect between his course content and the final's scope. While he seems to prepare students well if they actively engage with the homework, individual outcomes appear to vary significantly based on personal effort. Statics succeeds with him and students do well in Statics with him, but it seems that the final is very difficult.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/3036da17-d0a3-476d-9f31-cd268ed0e2df",
  "Mark Lewis": "Okay, based on the provided data, here's a summary of Professor Mark Lewis's teaching in SPC 201:\n\nProfessor Mark Lewis is known for his high energy and enthusiasm, particularly appreciated in late evening classes. While his overall rating is moderate, students seem to find his teaching style entertaining and helpful in easing anxiety related to public speaking. The quizzes can be challenging, requiring thorough reading of the material. Students may find his grading inconsistent and potentially subject to favoritism. Be mindful that he might be late for office hours due to commitments at other colleges. It's hard to say with the limited data which year succeeds or doesn't succeed, but the student comments suggest outgoing students might not have as much ease in the classroom.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/30527664-6bb5-4322-a36d-f743c3406aa2",

  "Sean Gager": "Based on the single evaluation provided, Professor Sean Gager of the IME department appears to be an excellent instructor. He is perceived as highly knowledgeable in his field, particularly manufacturing, and conveys his passion effectively. Students can expect clear presentation of course material and helpfulness in addressing any difficulties they may encounter. Furthermore, he provides extra credit opportunities, although the impact of these might be small. It's difficult to determine which years of students succeed more or less based on a single evaluation; more data is needed for that analysis.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/3074c7a5-859f-4607-9227-e4d07719770f",

Students describe his teaching as unstructured and lacking clear guidance, particularly on assignments. The course content seems to focus on practical advice for public planning agencies, but students feel unprepared and unsupported in the main assignment of creating a Planning Commission staff report. The final exam appears disconnected from the material covered in class, focusing on a book not discussed in lectures. Students report that class time is often unproductive due to poor management and disorganized lectures.

She's known for her strong grasp of the subject matter, especially when it comes to horses, and is considered approachable and easy to talk to. Students generally find her teaching of material clear, with a 3.79/4.0 rating. However, students may find the workload and depth of knowledge required in her courses, particularly ASCI 112, overwhelming if they lack prior experience in animal science.

Her lectures are image-based and supplemented with transcripts, aiding students in note-taking and journal completion. The course (LA 212) is writing-intensive, relying heavily on weekly journal submissions instead of traditional exams, and students should be prepared for a significant workload focused on journals and notes. Students should pay close attention to grammar in their written work, potentially utilizing tools like Grammarly to improve their submissions.\n\nBased on the course number (LA 212), which usually implies a lower division course, it is likely that freshmen and sophomores might find success in this course given the content and difficulty level is more attuned to their academic preparedness.

His ratings for \"Material Clear\" and \"Student Difficulties\" are also low, at 2.28/4.0 and 2.0/4.0 respectively, suggesting students find his teaching unclear and that he does not mitigate student challenges. Student comments indicate significant dissatisfaction with his teaching methods, stating he struggles to effectively explain problem-solving and often skips steps. Students perceive a lack of support, describing instances of inconsistency in grading and a reluctance to help students. Students report feeling ill-prepared for assignments and tests despite attending class, with some even seeking outside help from older students. Based on his course list (ARCE 211 through ARCE 444), students in the 200, 300 and 400 level courses may struggle with his teaching style, particularly foundational courses like ARCE 211/212/222/223.\n\nHere are 5 descriptive sentences summarizing what students can expect:\n\n1.  Students can anticipate a lack of clarity in his explanations and teaching methods.\n2.  Expect inconsistencies in grading and a potential lack of support when seeking assistance.\n3.

Her course material is considered clear, and she effectively addresses student difficulties. The course, likely metal casting based on student feedback, is surprisingly enjoyable for students even if they weren't initially expecting it. Students can anticipate a hands-on, three-hour lab format that combines a shorter lecture with practical application involving molten metal. The workload appears light, consisting of homework questions and quizzes based on lecture notes, and a straightforward final exam.

His lectures are described as fast-paced and potentially frustrating, with slides that may not directly correlate to assessed material. Students can expect frequent quizzes covering readings and Netflix series, which are perceived as challenging due to their focus on minor details. Professor Keese offers extra credit opportunities to help offset quiz difficulty. Success in his courses likely hinges on prioritizing the lecture slides provided before exams and taking advantage of extra credit. Freshmen may struggle with the pace and quiz style, while upperclassmen may find it easier to adapt to his unique teaching methods.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/42c8876c-bad4-4e44-a8a9-e6c108a2a764",

Students find his lectures boring and have expressed concerns about his delivery style. He relies heavily on textbook slides, which he often reads verbatim, and students note his difficulty in explaining concepts clearly due to his accent and stumbling over words. The workload appears manageable, with weekly homework assignments and exams that allow for equation sheets. Attendance is important, as it seems to be a factor in the course.\n\n**Here are 5 descriptive sentences:**\n\n1.  Professor Ahmed's lectures are perceived as dull, primarily consisting of reading directly from textbook slides.\n2.  Students have reported difficulties understanding him due to his accent and stumbles in speech.\n3.

The workload is relatively light, consisting of a few assignments such as essays, midterms (often online and take-home), a sketchbook assignment, and possibly a group presentation instead of a final. While students find the material easy to grasp, the lectures are often described as boring, with Professor Sandwick primarily lecturing and students struggling to maintain engagement. Students may find the professor scattered and explanations sometimes lacking, so they might need to supplement the lectures with their own efforts. The consensus is that while not a bad teacher, students might find the class uninteresting but manageable, as long as they stay on top of the assignments.

While the data is limited, student comments suggest a mixed experience depending on the course. For COMS 385, she's praised for being understanding and accommodating, rewarding effort and making a challenging course worthwhile. However, for COMS 100, there are criticisms about excessive and seemingly pointless workload, strict attendance policies, and lectures perceived as unhelpful.\n\nHere are 5 descriptive sentences about Professor Cheung:\n\n1.

He is perceived as willing to help students who actively seek assistance, particularly during office hours. Expect challenging course content, specifically requiring critical thinking skills. The course structure typically involves three tests with short answer questions and a multiple-choice final, with no homework. Students find his lecture notes valuable, potentially more so than the course readings themselves. Since the professor teaches a wide variety of course offerings from freshman courses (HNRS 230) all the way to senior courses (PHIL 457), it would be inappropriate to imply that one year succeeds while the other doesn't.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/435cf0cd-2be9-4397-8af1-9bbb001310da",

Students appreciate his clarity in explaining complex topics, though his \"Material Clear\" rating suggests room for improvement. Some students find him to be one of the best professors they've had, highlighting his organization, investment in student learning, and helpfulness during activities. While some students enjoy his laid-back approach with manageable quizzes and homework, other students find the class to be a waste of time and hard to follow, suggesting an inconsistency in course effectiveness or teaching style. There are mentions of a potential language barrier due to his accent, and random class participation, although it is not heavily penalized. Based on the courses listed (211, 212, 223, 306, 412), it appears that students in introductory to mid-level courses (200-300 level) may find his teaching style more effective, while feedback for more advanced courses (400 level) is lacking in the given data, making it difficult to determine his effectiveness with upper-level students.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/436ac3ea-924c-40be-a4da-356210634e01",

Students particularly struggle with the clarity of the material and the difficulty they experience in his courses. A recurring theme in student feedback highlights a disconnect between the material covered in class and the content assessed on exams. He appears very knowledgeable in the subject because of his position as mayor. It's been mentioned that the professor likes to bring up the fact that he is a mayor.\n\nBased on polyratings data, some students report achieving satisfactory grades if they focus on conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization of specific details.

However, at least one commenter from the early 1970s praises Dr. Hsieh as the \"BEST\" ARCE instructor, describing him as prepared, clear, and engaging in teaching structural design. It seems that students from the earlier years (early 1970s) viewed him as one of the best in the department while recent students feel that his class is a waste of time.

The \"Material Clear\" and \"Student Difficulties\" ratings both also stand at 1.5/4.0, which means students might find the material unclear and encounter difficulties in his AGB 101 course. However, keep in mind, this is based on very limited data.\n\nHere are 5 descriptive sentences about Professor Herlihy, keeping in mind the small sample size:\n\n1.  Professor Herlihy's teaching in AGB 101 is described as somewhat unclear, at least according to one evaluation.\n2.  Students may face challenges understanding the material in his course based on the single review available.\n3.  The professor's ratings for clarity and addressing student difficulties are both relatively low.\n4.  One student reviewer has shared a positive experience, saying that expectations were clear and grading was generous.\n5.  A single student highly recommends him for all Agricultural Business students.\n\nGiven the extremely limited data (only one evaluation), it's impossible to determine which years of students might succeed or struggle more in Professor Herlihy's class. More data is needed to identify any potential trends.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/7397449f-4d09-42f5-b21c-d65e975b8b9b",

  "Gita Kolluru": "Okay, here's a summary of Professor Gita Kolluru's data from your provided information:\n\nProfessor Gita Kolluru in the BIO department has an overall rating of 3.11/4.0 based on 48 evaluations. Students generally find her to be a very kind and engaging instructor. Her teaching is regarded as clear (3.38/4.0) and she makes complex biological concepts accessible. However, students also report that her courses can be quite challenging (Student Difficulties: 2.99/4.0), requiring substantial study time even for a GE course. While liberal arts majors and students who enjoy her lectures seem to thrive, others may find the workload demanding. Based on the available information, it is difficult to gauge which years succeed and don't succeed in Professor Kolluru's classes.\n\nIn summary:\n\n*   Professor Kolluru is known for being a very nice and approachable instructor.\n*   Students can expect engaging and interesting lectures filled with fun facts and discussions.\n*   She has a knack for making biology accessible, even to students outside of the sciences.\n*   Her courses, particularly BIO 123, BIO 263 and BIO 414, can be challenging and require significant study effort.\n*   Success in her classes seems tied to enjoying her teaching style and dedicating time to reviewing the material.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/8e923ce0-c1a2-4910-a2fb-f20bfc14f898",

  "Jagjit Singh": "Here's a summary of Professor Jagjit Singh based on the provided data:\n\nProfessor Singh's overall rating is somewhat below average, suggesting students have mixed experiences in his courses. Students often describe his lectures as heavily reliant on PowerPoint slides, which are also available online. Many feel the class relies on rote memorization of details from the slides, particularly for exams, and perceive the lectures as not particularly engaging or stimulating. While some students found the courses easy to pass by focusing on midterms, finals, and the group project, others felt the professor didn't teach much beyond what's on the slides. Based on course numbers (IT 303, IT 330, IT 331, IT 408, IT 457, IT 475), it seems he teaches a mix of upper-division courses, meaning juniors and seniors take these courses.\n\nHere are 5 descriptive sentences:\n\n1.  Professor Singh's teaching style is heavily dependent on PowerPoint presentations, which students are expected to download and follow.\n2.  Students find that success in his courses relies heavily on memorizing a large volume of material from the slides.\n3.  Engagement and stimulation in the classroom are generally reported to be low.\n4.  While some students consider the course easy to pass, others find the focus on memorization unhelpful.\n5.  Juniors and Seniors can expect to engage with course concepts such as software package management.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/be70dc23-af2a-4167-ac81-88672ab8109e",
  "Ray Terry": "Here's a summary of Professor Ray Terry based on the provided data:\n\nProfessor Terry's overall rating is quite low at 1.87/4.0 based on 106 evaluations, suggesting widespread dissatisfaction among students. His clarity of material (1.99/4.0) and handling of student difficulties (1.51/4.0) also score poorly, indicating potential issues in conveying concepts and providing support. Despite the low scores, some students find his teaching style amusing or beneficial, particularly those new to calculus, potentially making MATH 141 accessible. His exam structure is perceived as easier than the in-class examples and worksheets. However, other students report negative experiences, although the comment is cut short. Based on this information it is suggested that a student succeeds when they are new to calculus but if they are a higher level student they may struggle.\n\nHere are 5 descriptive sentences about Professor Terry:\n\n1.  Professor Terry's teaching is often described as slow-paced, which may benefit students new to calculus.\n2.  Students may find his lectures amusing due to his mannerisms, like obstructing the board while writing.\n3.  Despite covering challenging problems in class, assessments may focus on more basic applications of the concepts.\n4.  The low ratings suggest there are significant issues with the clarity and support provided to students.\n5.  Experience in calculus is not required to succeed, as Professor Terry focuses on the basics, but higher level students may struggle.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/be71902d-4975-4701-aace-c8af538b4706",

Students appreciate his humor and approachability. His courses, including ASCI 220, DSCI 301, and ASCI 101, are noted for having minimal workload, with no assigned homework or textbook. Students can expect iClicker quizzes that are primarily participation-based, and midterms are considered relatively easy, as he provides ample preparation. However, some students feel he rushes through the material, and that his lecture slides lack sufficient detail which can lead to difficulty taking notes. Students who are self-motivated and seek clarification during office hours tend to succeed, while those who struggle with fast-paced lectures might find the material challenging to grasp.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/bec98738-4464-4b5d-8263-9d9f7a64ae2e",
  "Ashley McDonald": "Okay, here's a summary of Professor Ashley McDonald based on the provided data:\n\nProfessor McDonald's overall rating is quite low, suggesting widespread student dissatisfaction. Students struggle significantly with both the clarity of the material and the difficulty of the course content, as indicated by the low scores in those categories. Student comments highlight concerns about her teaching methods, which some perceive as ineffective and irritating, citing repetitive jokes and unhelpful explanations. The heavy reliance on fixed lab partners and the lack of sufficient support during class appear to be significant obstacles for many students. While office hours are mentioned as potentially helpful, students need to come prepared with specific questions. Based on the courses taught, lower-division students (CHEM 111, 124, 127, 128) may struggle, while upper-division students (CHEM 351, 352, 353, 357) who have a solid foundation may have a better experience, although all levels are represented in the negative reviews.\n\nHere are 5 descriptive sentences:\n\n1.  Professor McDonald receives low overall ratings, indicating prevalent student dissatisfaction.\n2.  Students find the course material unclear and struggle with the course's difficulty.\n3.  Teaching methods, including repetitive jokes and seemingly unhelpful explanations, are a source of frustration for many.\n4.  The fixed lab partner system can be detrimental, particularly for students paired with someone equally lost.\n5.

A recurring theme is that her multiple-choice tests can be challenging, although she offers some assistance with essay questions. Her biggest attribute is her enthusiasm towards the course material.

Professor Jones is generally considered a decent instructor, with some students expressing wishing they had him for other courses.\n2.  Lectures can be perceived as dry, but attendance is beneficial due to the relevance of the content to assessments.\n3.  Tests are generally considered fair, with an emphasis on understanding lecture material.\n4.  Students should be prepared for statically indeterminate problems and focus their studying on lecture notes rather than homework alone.\n5.  He provides prepared notes that students fill in during lectures, and assessments include chapter tests and pop quizzes based on homework problems.\n\nThe student comments do not have enough information about students who fail.

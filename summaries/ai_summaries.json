  "Danielle Steussy": "Professor Steussy is a relatively new GRC professor and a Cal Poly alumna. While considered a supportive and approachable instructor (\"a saint\" compared to another professor), her lack of experience and current GrC knowledge can lead to confusion and frustration in the classroom. Students may encounter troubleshooting issues she can't immediately resolve. On the positive side, she's highly responsive to emails and offers flexibility with assignment deadlines. Her strengths lie in her accessibility and willingness to help students. https://polyratings.dev/professor/0099c43a-2262-4788-a0a9-dc920cce01b9",
  "Amanda Lathrop": "Here's a summary of Professor Lathrop's performance based on the provided data:\n\nProfessor Amanda Lathrop in the FSN department receives mixed reviews, with an overall rating of 2.22/4.0. Students find the course material somewhat clear (2.67/4.0), but struggle significantly with the difficulty (1.89/4.0). She is often perceived as a tough grader, and students find her expectations to be very high. A common complaint is the overwhelming amount of information presented in lectures, often read directly from powerpoints, making test preparation challenging and leading to frustration. While students may find her knowledgeable and like her as a person, the demanding nature of her courses can lead to burnout, and a need for a break from her teaching style. Based on the courses she teaches (FSN 125 and FSN 275), it is likely that Freshman and Sophomores struggle most with her rigor, whereas Juniors and Seniors are more accustomed to these challenges.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/00f2faeb-fd74-42d0-a3dc-80399f998432",
  "Nancy Rucci": "Okay, based on the provided data, here's a summary of Professor Rucci:\n\nProfessor Rucci receives mixed reviews, averaging a 2.5/4.0 overall rating. Students generally acknowledge her positive and understanding attitude. Some find her teaching style unstructured and feel she doesn't adequately explain concepts, especially in introductory courses. Others appreciate her interactive classes, willingness to answer questions clearly, and incorporation of cultural elements. The comments suggest that homework and tests are relatively easy, providing an opportunity to achieve a good grade with consistent attendance. Students taking lower level spanish courses may find it harder to understand due to a glossing over of some concepts. Students taking higher level courses tend to enjoy her teaching style.\n\nhttps://polyratings.dev/professor/014d53f2-90d0-46ad-a3fc-0877e2238b08"
